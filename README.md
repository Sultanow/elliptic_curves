# The Idea

The original idea was to investigate whether the product of two odd primes `p < q` is a congruent number. Our research deals with the fact whether an elliptic curve has rational points or not, focusing on a special family of curves, namely `y<sup>2</sup>=x<sup>3</sup>-pqx`.

The idea of this project is described by our [Paper "On families of elliptic curves y<sup>2</sup>=x<sup>3</sup>-pqx](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00215).
