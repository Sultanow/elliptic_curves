# The Idea

The original idea was to investigate whether the product of two odd primes `p < q` is a congruent number.

Our research deals with the fact whether an elliptic curve has rational points or not, focusing on a special family of curves, namely `y^2=x^3-pqx`.

The idea of this project is described by our [Paper "On families of elliptic curves E(p,q):y^2=x^3-pqx (Work in Progress)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00215).
